d) Use of instanceof operator
e) Difference between class and interface

b) Keywords break vs continue
    The break and continue keywords are used to control loop flow. The break keyword is used to immediately terminate a loop or a switch statement, 
transferring control to the statement after the loop or switch. On the other hand, the continue keyword skips the current iteration of the loop and 
moves control to the next iteration, allowing the loop to continue executing without completing the current cycle. Both keywords help manage loop 
execution effectively.

c) Role of access modifiers
    Access modifiers in Java define the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables in a program, helping in encapsulation 
and security. The four access modifiers are private, default, protected, and public. A private member is accessible only within 
its class, default allows access within the same package, protected allows access within the same package and subclasses, and public allows access 
from any class. This helps manage controlled access to data and methods in Java.

d) Use of instanceof operator
    The instanceof operator in Java is used to check whether a given object is an instance of a specific class or implements a particular interface,
returning true if it matches and false otherwise. It is useful for type checking before casting objects, which helps prevent ClassCastException at 
runtime. This operator is often used in polymorphic scenarios, where objects of different subclasses are handled, to ensure that the object is 
safely cast to its intended type.

e) Difference between class and interface
    A class can have fields and method implementations and is used to create objects, while an interface contains abstract methods and cannot create 
objects. A class supports single inheritance, while interfaces allow multiple inheritance in Java.
