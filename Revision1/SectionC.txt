a) Java class and object
    In Java, a class is a blueprint that defines attributes and methods, while an object is an instance of the class that holds actual data 
and behaviors. For example, a Car class may have fields like color and methods like drive(), and when you create Car c = new Car();, c becomes 
an object with its own data.

b) Constructor overloading
    Constructor overloading means having multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists. It allows creating objects in 
different ways with various initial values, increasing flexibility while initializing objects in Java.

c) Access modifiers
    Access modifiers control the visibility of classes, variables, and methods in Java. public allows access from anywhere, private restricts 
access to within the same class, protected allows access within the package and subclasses, while the default modifier limits access within the 
package.

d) Importance of the main method
    The main method is the entry point of every Java program, defined as public static void main(String[] args). It allows the JVM to start program 
execution, and without it, a Java program cannot run.

e) Logical Operators in Java
    Logical operators in Java are used to combine boolean expressions. These include && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT), helping in decision-making by 
evaluating multiple conditions together in control statements.
Eg:
if (a > 0 && b > 0) { } // true if both a and b > 0
